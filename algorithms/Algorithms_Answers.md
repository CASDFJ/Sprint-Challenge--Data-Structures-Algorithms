Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

Exercise I

a) O(n^3) because of the time it takes for the while condition to
stop.

Real answer is O(n)

b) Would be O(n^4) due to the fact that their are 4 for loops

Real answer is O(n)

c) O(n)

Exercise II
If the building was 100 stories I would start with the first 50 floors. So whatever the overall height is, I would do half of the entire building. So if I go to floor 51 and the egg breaks, I know not to go above. Otherwise, I would then half the floors again thus making it 25 floors and seeing where it breaks again.
